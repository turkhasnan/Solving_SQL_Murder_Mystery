-- Clue from Jeremy: 
-- hired by rich woman: 65"-67", red hair, tesla model s, sql symph 3 times in December 2017

-- 2 ways we can go about this:
-- First way - 
-- we look through the FB events and see who went to the concert 3 times
-- and investigate their wealth

-- added the limit because there were only 2 people who went 3 times:
-- Bryan Pardo and Miranda Priestly
-- Jeremy said that a rich woman hired him. 

-- Well I don't want to assume gender, so let's find their ssn and get their income
select i.annual_income, p.name
from income i left join person p on i.ssn = p.ssn
where (p.name like 'Miranda_Priestly' or p.name like 'Bryan%');
-- Miranda is def rich w/ 310k income, but Bryan does not have a ssn...
-- Interesting...

-- Need to confirm that Bryan has an ssn and is in Person table
select name, ssn
from person
where name like 'Bryan_Pardo';
-- Bryan's ssn is 816663882 so let's see if an income matches the ssn
select i.annual_income, p.name
from income i left join person p on i.ssn = p.ssn
where i.ssn = 816663882;
-- no result. So, we move on to Miranda.

-- Lets match Miranda's description with what Jeremy said
-- joining person table and driver's license
select p.name, d.height, d.hair_color, d.gender, d.car_make, d.car_model
from person p left join drivers_license d on p.license_id = d.id
where name like 'Miranda_Priestly';
-- everything matches Jeremy's description

/*With that being said, Jeremy is probably the killer since they were recognized
	by Annabel at the gym. Jeremy also said he was hired by a rich woman. 
	Rich woman concluded to be Miranda and confirmed description.
	Miranda is the real mastermind.*/
